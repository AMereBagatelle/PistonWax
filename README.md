# PistonWax

Allows you to wax pistons with a honeycomb.  That's all there is to it.

## Usage

Install this mod on the server (or integrated server).
Right click on the piston with a honeycomb to wax it.
This mod can be configured via the `pistonwax.txt` file in the config directory - the only parameter is loudness, so the file is simply a decimal number representing how loud you want waxed pistons to be.

Pistons that are broken and picked up will not retain their waxed state.  This is intentional.  There is no physical 
indicator of whether a piston is waxed, but it should be pretty obvious when you fire it.
