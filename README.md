# PistonWax

Allows you to wax pistons with a honeycomb.  That's all there is to it.

## Usage

Load it in and it will be active.  Right click on the piston with a honeycomb to wax it.
This mod can be configured via the pistonwax.txt file - the only parameter is loudness, so the file is simply a decimal number representing how loud you want waxed pistons to be.
